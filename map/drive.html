      Google Drive is a cloud storage service developed by Google that allows
      users to store, share, and access files from any device with an internet
      connection. It offers 15 GB of free storage space, which is shared across
      Gmail, Google Photos, and Drive itself. Users can upload various file
      types, such as documents, photos, videos, and PDFs, and can also create
      and collaborate on files like Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides in
      real-time. Google Drive's sharing features make it easy for individuals
      and teams to collaborate, and it integrates seamlessly with other Google
      Workspace apps.
